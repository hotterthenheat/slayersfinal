  SLAYER TERMINAL - MARKET CALENDAR
  One source of truth for "is the market open on
  this date", and for turning a horizon in days
  into a REAL expiry.

  Born because the weigher was doing
  `Date.now() + dte * 86400000` and happily listing
  contracts that expire on a Saturday. Options
  expire on trading days; anything that names an
  expiry has to come through here.

  HOW LONG A REGULAR SESSION IS, in one place.

  09:30 to 16:00 New York — 6.5 hours, 390 minutes. It was written out as a
  bare `6.5` in four modules (`vannacharm`, `volDrift`, `contractScore`) and as
  the derived `390` in a fifth (`simulator`'s SESSION_BARS), so the session
  length was five facts that happened to agree.

  It lives in the calendar because that is the module that already owns when
  the market is open, and because the Globex work (T-8) makes this number
  wrong: once the desk knows about the overnight session, "how much of the day
  is left" stops being a fraction of 6.5 and everything reading it has to
  follow. One constant means one edit; five means four of them drift.

  ══ T-16 — THE FUTURES CLOCK ══════════════════════════════════════════════

  The equity tape this desk draws stops at 16:00; the futures market that
  decides the next open barely stops at all. This model knows WHERE IN THE
  GLOBEX WEEK a wall-clock instant sits — the first piece of T-16, and the
  piece that is pure calendar. The overnight TAPE (session shading down the
  pane, the overnight high/low carried into the open) waits on MKT Futures:
  there is no honest way to shade an Asia session over bars that do not
  exist, so the chip ships now and the shading ships with the feed.

  THE WEEK, in New York wall time (DST rides free — every read goes through
  America/New_York, never a fixed UTC offset):

    Sunday 18:00 the week opens · Mon–Thu 17:00→18:00 daily maintenance ·
    Friday 17:00 the week closes. Inside a trading day:
      18:00 → 03:00  GLOBEX · ASIA
      03:00 → 09:30  GLOBEX · EUROPE   (London at the desk's 03:00)
      09:30 → 16:00  RTH               (the cash session this desk draws)
      16:00 → 17:00  GLOBEX · POST     (the hour after the cash close)

  HOLIDAYS ARE AN APPROXIMATION, and say so here: CME trades shortened
  hours on most equity holidays, but the desk's holiday table is the cash
  market's — a holiday reads CLOSED until the futures feed carries the real
  product calendar. Early closes (day-after-Thanksgiving et al.) are out of
  scope for the same reason.
