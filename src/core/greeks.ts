  SLAYER TERMINAL - BLACK-SCHOLES GREEKS (greeks.ts)
  Pure math, no state, no clock. Extracted from the
  simulator so the SCORING engine can price greeks
  without importing the simulator at all — a replay
  process that pulls in core/simulator boots the
  whole synthetic market (seeded history, timers,
  Math.random), which is exactly what a backtest
  must never do.

  The simulator now imports THIS, so live and replay
  price greeks with byte-identical code.
==================================================

  P-24A — THE CARRY, AND WHAT CHANGED WITH IT.

  This file priced everything at a hardcoded `r = 0.05` with NO dividend
  yield. Both now come from `core/carry.ts`, which is a seam rather than a
  constant: today it serves named assumptions and says so, and when the
  rates add-on lands nothing here changes. Every formula below is the
  generalized (continuous-yield) Black-Scholes, so q = 0 reproduces the old
  arithmetic exactly wherever the old arithmetic was right.

  ONE PLACE IT WAS NOT RIGHT, and it is worth naming because the numbers on
  screen move: the put charm was `charmCall + r·e^{−rt}`. In this model
  Δput = e^{−qt}(N(d1) − 1), so ∂Δput/∂t and ∂Δcall/∂t differ by exactly
  q·e^{−qt} — a DIVIDEND term, not a rate one. At the old q = 0 the two
  charms must be EQUAL, and the old code had them differing by ~5% of the
  discount factor. The generalized formulas below make the pair consistent
  with the deltas they are the time-derivative of, and the proof pins that
  relationship rather than the literal number, so a future refactor cannot
  quietly reintroduce it.

  THE VEGA SCALING TRAP (P-24D). `vega` and `rho` here are PER ONE POINT of
  their input — per 1% of vol, per 1% of rate — because that is what a
  reader means by "vega". The raw partials are per 1.00, so both are divided
  by 100 INSIDE this file. A feed that quotes per-1.00 vega therefore needs
  dividing by 100 ONCE, on ingest — never again here. Ingesting and
  rescaling double-scales by 100× and produces plausible wrong numbers
  rather than an error, which is why the proof asserts the convention
  directly.
