==================================================
  SLAYER TERMINAL - FLIP PROXIMITY (data/flipGauge.ts)

  The most-consulted number on a dealer desk, as a
  header strip rather than a chart read — P-4.
==================================================

  WHAT IT ANSWERS. Which side of the gamma flip the market is on, how far the
  flip is, and how many times it has been crossed today. Every Pinpoint desk
  already draws the flip; none of them ANSWER it — the reader takes it off a
  chart, every time, on the page whose whole subject is dealer positioning.

  THE REGIME FOLLOWS THE HOUSE'S OWN SIGN CONVENTION, read from where spot
  sits against the flip, not from the aggregate sign. exposure.ts states the
  spatial fact this encodes: "Above the flip dealers dampen the tape; below it
  they chase it." Above = call-dominant side = dealers LONG gamma = moves
  absorbed. Below = put-dominant side = dealers SHORT gamma = moves amplified.
  The aggregate (netGex > 0) answers a different question — which side
  OUTWEIGHS — and the two disagree precisely when spot is near the flip, which
  is when this strip matters most.

  CROSSINGS ARE COUNTED AGAINST EACH BAR'S OWN FLIP, not today's flip laid
  over the whole session. The flip MIGRATES — that is the entire premise of
  the Vanna & Charm page — so "crossed 2× today" has to mean price crossed
  the line as it stood at the time, or a morning flip five points away turns
  into crossings that never happened.

  NO FLIP IS A REAL STATE, carried as null and rendered as such. A one-sided
  book has no crossing; a gauge that silently substituted spot would read as
  "the flip is exactly at the market", which is the opposite claim. The rule
  itself is core/walls.ts's `pickFlip` — the ONE copy, which this file is the
  fifth reader of and the reason it stopped being written inline.

  THE FLIP, BY EXPIRY — P-9.

  Three answers to one question, because the books are different books: the
  0DTE lens is what evaporates at today's bell, the weekly is the trade the
  street is carrying, and the whole book is the structure underneath both.
  They routinely disagree, and the disagreement is the read — a 0DTE flip
  below spot under a whole-book flip above it is a pinned morning and a
  directional afternoon.

  EACH LENS'S OWN WINDOWED PROFILE, through buildExposureProfile — the same
  seam, the same EXPIRY_DECAY model, the same numbers the map and the matrix
  draw for that lens. Computing a "0DTE flip" off anything other than what
  the 0DTE view shows would let this row disagree with the page it sits on.

  THE SPREAD IS BOOK − 0DTE: how far the structure sits from today's
  artifact. Null unless both exist, because a spread against a book with no
  flip is not a number.

  WHAT THE THREE LENSES CAN AND CANNOT SAY, as of P-24B.

  The expiry lens is a UNIFORM POSITIVE SCALAR over every strike
  (`EXPIRY_DECAY` in data/exposure.ts: 0DTE 1, 7D 0.16, ALL 3.13). Scaling a
  whole book by a positive constant cannot move a sign change — so on this
  data source the three flips are the SAME PRICE, necessarily, and the panel
  says so rather than implying three measurements happened to coincide.

  They used to differ, and that difference was not real: the profile's
  per-strike jitter was seeded with the expiry NAME, so a hash of the string
  "7D" tilted near-balanced strikes and produced three numbers. The
  divergence measured when this feature was built (6 of 22 names) was
  measuring that hash. P-24B made the split net-preserving — levels are now
  a property of the book, not of the seed — and the three lenses collapsed
  onto one price, which is the honest reading of a book with no per-expiry
  structure in it.

  THE SHAPE STAYS because the seam is the point: a real chain carries its own
  open interest per expiry, those are three genuinely different books, and
  this function differentiates them the moment it is handed them. That is
  proven with a staged per-expiry book in the proof rather than asserted
  here.
