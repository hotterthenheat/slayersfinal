==================================================
  SLAYER TERMINAL - FLIP PROXIMITY (data/flipGauge.ts)

  The most-consulted number on a dealer desk, as a
  header strip rather than a chart read — P-4.
==================================================

  WHAT IT ANSWERS. Which side of the gamma flip the market is on, how far the
  flip is, and how many times it has been crossed today. Every Pinpoint desk
  already draws the flip; none of them ANSWER it — the reader takes it off a
  chart, every time, on the page whose whole subject is dealer positioning.

  THE REGIME FOLLOWS THE HOUSE'S OWN SIGN CONVENTION, read from where spot
  sits against the flip, not from the aggregate sign. exposure.ts states the
  spatial fact this encodes: "Above the flip dealers dampen the tape; below it
  they chase it." Above = call-dominant side = dealers LONG gamma = moves
  absorbed. Below = put-dominant side = dealers SHORT gamma = moves amplified.
  The aggregate (netGex > 0) answers a different question — which side
  OUTWEIGHS — and the two disagree precisely when spot is near the flip, which
  is when this strip matters most.

  CROSSINGS ARE COUNTED AGAINST EACH BAR'S OWN FLIP, not today's flip laid
  over the whole session. The flip MIGRATES — that is the entire premise of
  the Vanna & Charm page — so "crossed 2× today" has to mean price crossed
  the line as it stood at the time, or a morning flip five points away turns
  into crossings that never happened.

  NO FLIP IS A REAL STATE, carried as null and rendered as such. A one-sided
  book has no crossing; a gauge that silently substituted spot would read as
  "the flip is exactly at the market", which is the opposite claim. The rule
  itself is core/walls.ts's `pickFlip` — the ONE copy, which this file is the
  fifth reader of and the reason it stopped being written inline.
