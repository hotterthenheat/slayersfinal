==================================================
  SLAYER TERMINAL - THE EXPIRY LADDER (data/expiryLadder.ts)

  Which expiry owns this strike — P-2.
==================================================

  THE QUESTION THE EXPOSURE PROFILE CANNOT ANSWER. That surface shows one
  expiry lens at a time, so a wall reads the same whether it is a 0DTE
  artifact that evaporates at the bell or a monthly shelf that has been
  there for three weeks and will still be there tomorrow. Those are
  opposite trades. The ladder puts the lenses side by side — strikes down,
  expiries across — so the composition of a level is one glance.

  BUILT ON THE SAME SEAM AS EVERY OTHER SURFACE. Each column is
  `buildExposureProfile` under its own lens, so the ladder cannot disagree
  with the profile a reader opens next: same window, same dealer sign
  convention, same numbers. When P-1's swap lands and the expiry breakdown
  becomes measured rather than modelled, this file changes not at all.

  WHAT THE CELLS MEAN, and the one thing they must not imply. Each cell is
  that lens's net GEX at that strike. The lenses are CUMULATIVE-ISH rather
  than disjoint — ALL is the whole pipeline, not the sum of the columns
  beside it — so the ladder never prints a total across a row: adding lenses
  that overlap would produce a number that means nothing. The row's summary
  is instead the lens that DOMINATES it, which is the actual question.

  DOMINANCE IS BY MAGNITUDE, and among the dated lenses only. ALL is
  excluded from the dominance read for the same reason it is excluded from
  any sum: it is the aggregate, so it would win every row and say nothing.
