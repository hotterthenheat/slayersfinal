==================================================
  SLAYER TERMINAL - AIR POCKETS (data/airPockets.ts)

  Where price does NOT stop — P-5.
==================================================

  A WALL TELLS YOU WHERE PRICE STOPS. An air pocket tells you where it
  doesn't: a contiguous run of strikes carrying almost no dealer gamma,
  sitting between two shelves that carry plenty. There is no hedging flow in
  there to slow anything down, which is the mechanical explanation for the
  moves that look like nothing happened — price crosses the range in seconds
  because nothing was mechanically obliged to lean against it.

  THE DEFINITION, and every threshold in it argued rather than tuned:

    NEAR-ZERO is relative to the book, not absolute. A strike carrying under
    QUIET_SHARE of the window's HEAVIEST strike is quiet — on a $600 index
    and a $12 name alike, because both are read against their own book. An
    absolute dollar floor would call every strike on a small name an air
    pocket.

    A RUN IS AT LEAST MIN_STRIKES wide. Two quiet strikes between two shelves
    is the ordinary texture of any book; the read only means something when
    the gap is wide enough that price crossing it has real distance to
    travel unopposed.

    IT MUST BE BETWEEN SHELVES. A quiet run at the END of the window is not a
    pocket — it is the edge of the book, where gamma thins out because there
    are no strikes left, not because the strikes there are empty. Requiring a
    heavy strike on BOTH sides is what separates "nothing here" from "nothing
    listed here".

    A SHELF IS SHELF_SHARE of the heaviest. Deliberately lower than a wall's
    bar: the pocket's claim is about what BOUNDS the emptiness, and a shelf
    that would lose a wall contest can still be the thing price stops at on
    the way through.

  ── WHAT THIS IS NOT, WHICH THE NAME ACTIVELY SUGGESTS ───────────────────

  "AIR POCKET" IS A DEPTH WORD. Every trader who reads it thinks of a thin
  ORDER BOOK — a price range with no resting bids to absorb a seller — and
  that is not what this measures and cannot be. There is no level-two source
  on this desk: no book depth, no resting size, no quote ladder. Nothing
  here has ever seen a bid it did not compute.

  WHAT IT ACTUALLY MEASURES is a GAMMA VOID in the options chain — a run of
  strikes carrying almost no dealer gamma. That is a real and defensible
  read, and it is a DIFFERENT CLAIM: it says nobody is mechanically obliged
  to trade against a move through here, not that nobody is willing to. A
  thin gamma band with a deep book still absorbs size; a fat gamma band with
  an empty book still gaps.

  The two coincide often enough that borrowing the word is fair. They
  coincide nowhere near always enough to leave the difference unsaid, so the
  glossary entry and the surface both say which one this is.

  MODELLED LIKE EVERY OTHER READ off this chain, and the provenance chip on
  the surface says so.
