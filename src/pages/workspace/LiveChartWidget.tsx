/*
==================================================
  SLAYER TERMINAL - WORKSPACE LIVE CHART
  The chart widget owns its own window. Each copy on
  the desk keeps its own timeframe and overlays, so
  two live charts side by side can watch the same
  name on different clocks — which is most of the
  reason to put two of them on a desk.

  State lives HERE rather than in the registry so
  every instance gets its own, for free.
