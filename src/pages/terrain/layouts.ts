==================================================
  SLAYER TERMINAL - NAMED LAYOUTS (terrain/layouts.ts)

  Save and recall whole desk arrangements — T-18.
==================================================

  A reader who builds a four-pane 0DTE desk in the morning and a two-pane
  swing desk at lunch should not rebuild either by hand. A named layout is
  the WHOLE arrangement — pane count, symbols, timeframes, overlays,
  indicators, styles — snapshotted under a name and recalled in one click.

  VALIDATION IS INJECTED, NOT COPIED. The desk already owns the one
  field-by-field pane validator (`readPane`), and this module takes it as an
  argument instead of holding a second enumeration of the pane's fields —
  the drawings validator was rebuilt around exactly that lesson (T-0: a
  kind-list copied inline dropped every stored measure). Same for the legal
  layout list. The proof stages its own validator, which is the point: this
  module's own logic is storage, names and caps, and that is what it proves.

  THE CAP REFUSES, IT DOES NOT EVICT. Twelve named desks is a workshop;
  silently dropping the oldest to admit a thirteenth is how a reader loses
  the one they built in March without being told. `saveNamedLayout` returns
  null at the cap and the menu says why.
