==================================================
  SLAYER TERMINAL - SYMBOL SETUPS (terrain/setups.ts)

  How a symbol remembers the way it was last set
  up, so picking it again brings that back.
==================================================

  WHY THIS EXISTS.

  A reader's NVDA trendlines already follow the NAME — drawings are stored per
  ticker. Their NVDA interval followed the SLOT. So switching a pane to NVDA
  restored the drawings and lost everything else, which is the kind of
  half-memory that reads as forgetfulness rather than as a decision.

  WHAT FOLLOWS THE SYMBOL, AND WHAT DOES NOT.

  Only the five chart fields in SETUP_KEYS. `ticker` and `ladder` stay with the
  slot: the rail is a 132px WIDTH decision that belongs to the arrangement, and
  the desk-wide Strikes button reads the panes precisely so it can never
  disagree with the screen — make the rail per-symbol and that button starts
  lying one symbol-switch later.

  AN ENTRY IS EARNED BY TOUCH, NOT BY DISPLAY.

  A symbol enters this map only when the reader moves a control while it is up,
  never because a pane happened to show it. That one rule is what makes the
  feature unsurprising: a pane can only ever be moved back to a setting the
  reader themselves chose for that name, and a symbol that has never been
  configured inherits whatever pane it lands in — which is byte-for-byte the
  behaviour before any of this existed. It also means there is no
  default-valued noise to prune later.

  This module holds no storage and no React. It is pure enough to be proved by
  a script, and its imports from StrikeChart are TYPE-ONLY on purpose: a value
  import would drag the charting library in and a plain `tsx` run could not
  load it.

  Sixty, argued from bytes rather than taste: one full entry with a comparison
  serialises to about 360 bytes, so sixty of them is ~21 KB against a 5 MB
  quota — four thousandths of it. A reader who has hand-configured more than
  sixty distinct names will not miss the sixty-first-oldest, and eviction drops
  a SETUP, never a pane — an evicted symbol simply inherits the pane again next
  time it is picked.

  The figures are MEASURED by `terrain-setups-proof.ts`, which prints both and
  holds the total under one percent of the quota. They were "240 bytes, ~14 KB"
  here until T-7's sixth field moved them, which is how a number written in a
  comment goes quietly wrong; the proof prints the live pair every run.

      This was `length === OVERLAY_KEYS.length`: a record had to carry EVERY

      is ADDED, at which point every setup ever saved is one key short and every
      symbol silently loses all of its overlays at once — up to sixty of them,
      for a key the reader has never heard of. Measured before the fix: adding
      `flow` dropped the overlays field from every stored symbol.

      A missing key now falls back to FALSE rather than to DEFAULT_OVERLAYS, and
      that is deliberate twice over. An overlay a reader never saw cannot have
      been chosen by them, so off is the honest reading of their intent. And
      importing the defaults here would pull a React component module into a
      file whose whole point is running headless in the proof.

      The floor stays at ONE recognised boolean, which is what keeps junk out:
      `{ trails: 'yes', ghost: true }` still yields no overlays at all rather
      than a full set of invented ones.

    block above was rewritten to stop using, sitting two lines below the comment
    explaining why it is wrong. `INDICATOR_KEYS` is currently the four EMAs and
    VWAP; the moment a fifth is added — RSI, MACD, Bollinger, anything — every
    stored record is one key short, fails the equality, and every symbol loses
    all of its indicators at once. Up to sixty of them, silently, for a key the
    reader has never heard of.

    Identical rule to the overlays, for the identical reason: a missing key
    falls back to FALSE (an indicator a reader never saw cannot have been chosen
    by them), and the floor stays at ONE recognised boolean so junk still yields
    nothing rather than a full set of invented values.
