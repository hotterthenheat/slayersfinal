==================================================
  SLAYER TERMINAL - TERRAIN (pages/terrain/Terrain.tsx)

  Charts, and nothing else. One to four of them,
  filling the screen, and EACH ONE IS ITS OWN
  WORKSPACE — its own symbol, interval, overlays,
  indicators and tape shape.
==================================================

  THE PANES ARE INDEPENDENT (Noah, 2026-08-25: "each chart box should have
  its own time frame area, it's own everything because each is different from
  the other ones"). The first cut shared one rail across every pane, on the
  reasoning that a three-up read only means something if the panes agree. That
  was the wrong call for this desk and it is reversed here: the panes are
  three different instruments at three different resolutions, and the whole
  point of putting them side by side is that they are set up differently.

  So the only things left on the top rail are the two that belong to the
  ARRANGEMENT rather than to any chart: how many panes there are, and whether
  they carry their strike rail. Everything else lives in the pane.

  WHAT A PANE CARRIES, top to bottom:

      symbol · price · session change      identity
      interval + overlays + indicators     ChartToolbar, `minimal`
      the three heaviest strikes near      the book, in one line
      spot, signed
      the chart, and its strike rail       StrikeChart + PaneLadder

  IT TAKES THE WHOLE SCREEN. The shell wraps every page in horizontal padding,
  20px above and 64px below, then ends it with the site footer. A workspace
  wants none of that, so the margins are cancelled and the height is pinned to
  the viewport less the top bar — measured at 56px, not guessed. The footer
  still follows, below the fold, exactly as it does on every other page.
  Below `lg` all of it comes off: the panes stack, the height cap lifts, and
  the page scrolls, because four charts sharing one phone screen is four
  charts nobody can read.

  WHY IT IS NOT THE 4-WAY BOARD. /pulse/board is four cells with four
  toolbars, fixed at four, on a page that scrolls. Terrain is one to four
  panes that own the viewport, with a strike rail and named levels on the
  axis. They have converged on per-pane controls, which is the right answer
  for both; what still separates them is the arrangement and the density.
*/

  WHAT THE FULL CONTROL STRIP NEEDS — inside the chart column, with the price
  gutter already taken off it.

  Measured against this build at 2560, where nothing can be forcing a wrap:
  the un-compacted toolbar lays out at 972px on one line. The timeframe strip
  is 289 of that (eight chips now — T-14's `15s` is 36px of the move below),
  `Replay` 78, the three worded triggers (Indicators 117 · Alerts 93 ·
  Candles 102) another 311, `Overlays 3` 117, `Theme` 89, and the rest gaps
  and dividers. Add the strip's 6px left pad and the toolbar band's 16px of
  `px-2` and the column has to give it 994px past the gutter.

  IT HAS MOVED THREE TIMES, and every time the control that moved it was in
  another file: 818 → 856 when T-1 wired the draw pencil, → 934 when T-13
  wired Replay, and → 972 when T-14 put `15s` on the picker. That is the
  whole hazard of a measured constant, and it is why the sweep asserts the
  PROPERTY — the toolbar occupies exactly one row at every width and layout —
  rather than this figure. The number here is the gate; the sweep is what
  notices when it is wrong (it did: two panes at 1180 wrapped over the tape
  for exactly the 38px the 15s chip is worth).

  T-7 ADDED NO WIDTH, and that was the deciding constraint rather than a happy
  accident: a price-scale trigger of its own is 39px at the very least, and the
  COMPACT strip has none to spare, so the scale folded into the Candles menu
  (see ChartToolbar). T-13's Replay is SHED in compact for the same budget —
  it has `p` and a badge, and the pencil has neither.

  The sweep asserts the PROPERTY as well as these figures: the toolbar
  occupies exactly one row at every width and layout. The next control to land
  in that strip fails a build rather than quietly wrapping it over the tape.

  Under that it does not clip or scroll, it WRAPS — the root is `flex-wrap`
  and the Indicators/Alerts/Candles span inside it wraps again. At 1024px with
  two grid columns the chart column is 369px, so 291px of line takes 818px of
  controls in FOUR rows: 126px of toolbar inside a 205px chrome stack over a
  411px pane — half the pane, sitting on the tape. On a coarse pointer
  `.chrome-hover` pins that visible (index.css), so it never goes away.

  It is a PANE width, not a window width: a four-pane desk at 1440px still
  gives each toolbar ~577px and still wraps.

  WHAT THE IDENTITY ROW COSTS, AND WHAT IT GIVES UP WHEN THE COLUMN CANNOT PAY.

  The row is `w-fit max-w-full` and every child is `shrink-0`, which caps the
  BOX at the column and lets the CONTENTS overflow it visibly. So it does not
  wrap and it does not clip — it prints past the pane's edge, onto the price
  ticks. Measured at a 1024px viewport with the rail up, where the chart column
  is 369px and the usable width is 287:

    padding 16 · badge 16 · symbol capsule 146 · link chip 26 · price 47 ·
    change 44 · expand 24 = 343 needed against 287 available, on ALL FOUR
    panes (341 on QQQ). (The link chip joined with T-20 — and joined these
    figures only after the sweep caught its 26px printing the row's tail on
    the axis at 1024-1280: one overflowing button per pane, the exact width
    of the part nobody had re-measured.)

  The 30px that did not fit was the EXPAND BUTTON, sitting on the price axis —
  in the shipped build, at a laptop width, with or without a second axis. The
  comment above this row says the identity and the button are fixed and only
  the strike read gives. That was not true, and this is what makes it true.

  The order things go in is by what the reader loses least:

    the CHANGE %  first — the price it is a delta of is still right there, and
                  the chart draws the same move. Costs 52 (44 + its gap).
    the BADGE     next — the symbol already names the pane; the number is only
                  a shorthand for it. Costs 24, and only exists at all when
                  more than one pane is up.
    the COMPARE + last — a control, so it goes last. Removing a comparison is
                  still possible from the legend's own x, and the menu comes
                  back the moment the column is wide enough. Costs 34, since
                  the button sits inside the capsule (146 = 112 + 6 + 28).
    the LINK CHIP sheds with the compare tier — but ONLY while it is unlinked,
                  when it is a convenience like the +. A pane that is LINKED
                  wears its letter at every width, the replay badge's rule:
                  a pane that follows another silently is a surprise, and
                  state is never shed.

  Thresholds are the cost of the NEXT tier down plus room to spare, because
  the parts are not fixed: `min-w-[112px]` on the symbol button is a floor, so
  a five-letter symbol grows it, and a four-figure price is wider than the
  $501.80 measured here. The sweep asserts the GEOMETRY — nothing over an axis
  — rather than these numbers, so a symbol that outgrows them fails the build
  instead of quietly printing on the ticks.

/*
  WHAT THE CONFLUENCE STRIP COSTS — T-12, MEASURED in this build at 1024–1920
  with two panes, not estimated. Each figure is the strip plus the row's 8px
  gap:

    FULL   `1m▼ 5m▼ 15m▼ 1h▬ 1D▲`   140 → 148, the timeframes named
    TIGHT  `▼▼▼▬▲`                    61 →  69, the SHAPE alone

  TWO FORMS, NOT A SHED ORDER, because there is only one thing here and
  dropping it leaves nothing. The tight form is not a degraded full one: what
  a reader takes from this strip in the first instant is whether the arrows
  AGREE, and five glyphs in a fixed order say that as well as five labelled
  ones. Which timeframe is which stays in the hover title and the accessible
  name — the same trade `compact` makes across the toolbar.

  It is the FIRST thing the identity row gives up, and it is gated on the row
  affording everything ELSE first: a strip that arrived by pushing the change
  percentage off the row would be trading a measurement for a summary of
  measurements.

  ON THE MARGINS. At the width the full form first appears the row sits about
  8px inside its box — thin, and deliberately not padded out. The box it would
  overflow is the strip's CONTENT box, and the strip's right padding IS the
  price-gutter clearance (PRICE_GUTTER_PX): a row that runs a few pixels long
  grows into 76px of clearance, not onto the price ticks. What the sweep holds
  is that geometry — nothing over an axis — rather than these figures, so a
  symbol or a price wider than the ones measured here fails a build instead of
  quietly printing on the ticks.

  Measured tiers with two panes: full to 1440 · tight at 1366 and 1280 · gone
  at 1180 and below, where the row is already shedding its own parts.

    ══ THE COMPARE LEGEND HAS TO START BELOW THE STRIP, NOT AT 46px ═════════

    The legend was pinned at `top-[46px]` — the strip's height when it holds
    one row. The strip is a `flex-col` and holds two whenever the toolbar is
    up, so on hover it grew over the legend and the legend is z-10 against the
    strip's z-20.

    Measured at 1440x900, one compare: legend row [19,109,109,16] against the
    heaviest-strike read [13,109,316,23] — 16px of 16 vertical overlap, 109 of
    109 horizontal. With four compares the Remove buttons land at y=109/127/
    145/163 and elementFromPoint at the third one's own centre returns the
    timeframe strip's button: that × cannot be clicked at all, even though it
    carries `pointer-events-auto`.

              ── who this pane is, and how it is set up ──────────────────
              FLOATING OVER THE TAPE, not stacked above it (Noah, 2026-08-25:
              "find a way in logic to make that stuff transparently fit into
              the chart screens so the charts can be damn near full screen").
              Two header rows in flow cost every pane ~56px of chart; over the
              tape they cost nothing, because the top of a chart is the
              emptiest part of it — price sits in the middle and volume at the
              floor.

              SCOPED TO THE CHART COLUMN, not the pane. Spanning the pane put
              the strip across the strike rail's own header and clipped it to
              "TRIKE ×". The rail is a sibling of this column, so bounding the
              overlay to the column is the fix — not a z-index, and not a
              right-margin that has to be kept in step with the rail's width.

              The strip is `pointer-events-none` and each control group turns
              them back on. Without that the invisible gaps BETWEEN the
              controls swallow drags on the chart underneath, and a chart you
              cannot pan by its top third is broken in a way that looks like
              nothing at all.

              the info you need but it comes and goes").

              Graded, not all-or-nothing, because the two rows answer
              different questions. WHAT AM I LOOKING AT is a question you have
              while your eyes are on the tape and your cursor is somewhere
              else entirely — so the symbol, price and change stay on screen,
              just quiet. HOW IS IT SET UP is a question you only have while
              you are reaching for a control, so the toolbar is not there at
              all until the cursor arrives. Hiding the symbol too would mean
              a four-pane desk where you cannot tell the panes apart without
              waving at each one.

              focus-within, not only hover: the toolbar is reachable by Tab,
              and a control you can focus but not see is worse than one you
              cannot reach. Keyboard focus brings the strip up exactly as the
              cursor does.

                 It used to be conditional, and the condition was covering for
                 a different bug. Taking the left gutter on a narrow pane moved
                 the collision to the RIGHT axis, so the clearance was gated on
                 the column being wide enough to hold both. But the right axis
                 was ALREADY being overprinted at those widths by 28-30px, with
                 or without a left one — the gate was not preventing that, only
                 declining to make it worse. Now that the row sheds parts to fit
                 (ID_ROW_* above), there is nothing to trade and the axis on

                happen to be, so a pane holding three $200M strikes pushed the
                expand button onto a second line while the pane beside it
                stayed on one. The strike read gives by carrying
                fewer entries, and the identity row gives by dropping parts of
                itself (ID_ROW_* above). Neither is ever cut mid-value.

                across the entire top of the tape — and pushed the expand icon
                out over the price ticks.

                Moving the read off did not fix that, it only made it smaller:
                identity ALONE still needed 317px of the 287 a 369px column
                gives, and the expand icon was still on the ticks. `max-w-full`

                     the seven timeframes collapse into the current interval
                     as a trigger, and every dropdown trades its word for its
                     icon, keeping the word as the hover/AT name.

                     Measured after: 818px of controls becomes 350px. Four
                     rows become one at 1280 and up in every layout (177px of
                     chrome down to 112, 43% of the pane down to 27%), and two
                     at 1024 with 2+ panes, where the column is only 369px
                     (205px down to 145, 50% down to 35%). The single wide
                     pane beside a narrow one keeps its full labels, because
                     the test is its own column's width.

                     THE 1180 CLAIM WAS WRONG, and by one pixel. This read
                     "one at 1180/1280 in every layout"; re-measured across
                     the whole width × layout matrix, at 1180 with 2+ panes
                     the toolbar's usable column is 349px and the compact
                     strip is 350, so it takes two rows there and always has.
                     The same 350-into-347 happens in the three-up at 1760,
                     which the old note did not mention either. Verified
                     against a clean build of the tree before T-7 — identical
                     at every cell — so it is a stale claim rather than a
                     regression, and the sweep now asserts what is true rather
                     than what was written. Closing that pixel means shrinking
                     a control that no current work touches; it is recorded
                     here rather than quietly rounded away. */

    `true` while nothing is drawn. Measured at 900x800 layout 3: three rails
    in the DOM, `display: "none"` and 0px wide, all three.

    That is deliberate and it stays — the rail is 132px, and the comment at the
    render site says why a narrow column cannot carry it. What was NOT
    deliberate is that the flag went on being read as if it were visible:

      · the arrangement bar held `right: 216px` (132 + the 76px price gutter +
        8) for a rail that is `display: none`, which put its Rows3 icon and
        its `1`/`2` buttons on the volume histogram with 135px of empty runway
        beside them. Measured at 768, 900 and a coarse-pointer 820x1180; at
        1024 the same expression is right and the gap is 3px.

      · STRIKES rendered lit, `aria-pressed="true"`, titled "Hide every strike
        rail". At 1023x800 a real mouse click on it rewrote all four panes'
        flags to `false` in storage and changed NOTHING on screen — 0 rails
        before, 0 after. The comment above the bar states the rule it broke:
        "A control that visibly does nothing when pressed is worse than an
        absent one."

    So the breakpoint is read wherever the flag is acted on, not just where the
    rail is drawn. The stored preference is still never touched by the window
    — it comes back the moment the reader is wide enough, which is the whole
    point of hiding by breakpoint rather than by config.
