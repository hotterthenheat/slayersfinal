 * - `listitem` — one card in a list of cards. A card may hold its own button
 *                (Compass cards carry "Analysis"), and `listitem` is the one of
 *                these three whose children are still exposed, so that nested
 *                button keeps its own name and its own focus stop.
 * - `native`   — leave the element's own role alone. This is what a `<tr>`
 *                needs: it is already a row inside its table, and overriding
 *                that to `button` deletes it from the table for every screen
 *                reader, which is what four desks were doing.

 * belongs to a listbox option, a tab, or a row inside a grid — none of which
 * these are — and setting it on a `button` is invalid, which axe reports as a
 * critical fault (143 of them across four desks before this changed).
 * `aria-current` is a global attribute, valid on every role here, and it says
 * the true thing: this is the one the desk is showing you right now.
