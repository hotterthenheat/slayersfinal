==================================================
  SLAYER TERMINAL - KEEPING A MENU OFF ITS ANCHOR
  (components/ui/useAnchoredMenu.ts)

  The React half of `menuPlacement.ts`: hold a ref on
  the trigger, and keep a fixed-position box for the
  menu current while it is open.

  IT IS A HOOK BECAUSE THERE ARE THREE MENUS. The
  toolbar's Dropdown solved this first and kept the
  plumbing inline; the symbol quick-pick and the
  compare '+' never got it, and stayed
  `absolute left-0 top-full` inside a pane whose box
  is `overflow-hidden`. Measured on the built desk at
  1024x768, four panes: the compare popover ran to
  x=517 against a pane clipping at x=509, so 8px of
  it was rendered and unreachable — the same defect
  menuPlacement.ts was written for, in the two
  components that never adopted it.

  Copying the plumbing into them would have made three
  copies of one rule, which is how the first one came
  to be the only correct one.

  The arithmetic stays in `menuPlacement.ts`, which
  imports no React so it can be tested on its own.

    THE MENU'S OWN WIDTH, MEASURED, when the caller cannot name it.

    The toolbar's Dropdown renders whatever child it is given, and those are
    not one width: `min-w-[210px]` on the wrapper, but AlertsMenu is
    `w-[228px]`, the chart-style menu comes out 230, and the candle theme 317.
    A per-menu constant here would be a number kept by hand next to a class
    that already says it — the same two-generators trap, and it would drift the
    first time a menu grew a row.

    Measured on the built desk, left-column pane, before this: chart style at
    x = -12, Alerts and candle theme at x = 0. All three exactly what a 210
    assumption predicts (210 -> 8, 218 -> 0, 230 -> -12), which is what said
    the assumption was the fault rather than the arithmetic.

    THE WIDEST SEEN WHILE OPEN, not the first. Taking the first reading was
    the obvious bound against a loop — re-placing feeds a new maxHeight, which
    can take a scrollbar away, which changes the width, which re-places again —
    and it was wrong in a way the measurement showed: the Alerts menu read 218
    on the first frame and settled at 226 once its scrollbar went, so it stayed
    clamped to a width it no longer had and sat at x = 0.

    A maximum converges instead of oscillating. Width can only grow a bounded
    number of times for fixed content, and each growth places the menu further
    from the edge, which never brings the scrollbar back.

    RE-READ THE WIDTH AFTER EVERY PLACEMENT, not once when the menu mounts.

    A ref CALLBACK fires on mount and never again while the element stays
    mounted, so it can only ever see the FIRST layout — which is the one placed
    from the assumed width, before any correction. Measured: the Alerts menu
    read 218 at mount and settled at 226 once its scrollbar went, and the
    correction never arrived because nothing sampled it again. It sat at x = 0
    instead of the 8px edge.

    Keyed on `placed`, so each placement gets a fresh reading. It terminates
    because `measured` only ever grows: a wider reading places the menu further
    from the edge, which cannot bring the scrollbar back, and an unchanged
    reading sets no state.

        /* THE GROWTH IS CAPPED, because it does not always converge.

           The reasoning here used to be "width can only grow a bounded
           number of times for fixed content". That is false for a menu
           whose content is FLUID and whose box is anchored by its RIGHT
           edge: each wider reading places the menu further from the screen
           edge, which hands its content more room, which reads wider again.
           Measured at 1024x768 on a four-pane desk: the Overlays menu
           walked 218 → 226 → 234 … 8px per pass, forever, until React threw
           "Maximum update depth exceeded" and the whole desk stopped
           rendering. The browser sweep caught it as a pane strip that
           vanished mid-walk.

           Two passes is what the real correction needs (the scrollbar
           going away is one step); past that the widest seen stands and the
           placement is simply clamped with it. A menu a few pixels narrower
           than it could be is invisible; a desk that stops rendering is
           not. */
