/* THE ENGINE'S STANDOUT IS MAGENTA, RESTORED (Noah, 2026-08-29, ending
   the day's odyssey magenta → silver → baby blue → neon → back: "i
   reveried and skylit doesnt have those colors"). What the odyssey KEPT:

   - `crown` — a BLACK BOX with magenta words (the grammar Noah chose
               during the neon leg: "mainly black with the words being
               [the accent]... that would really bring it out" — never a
               filled card). The engine's #1 and nothing lesser: TOP PICK.
   - `supreme`  — the magenta tint at chip scale: supreme tags, NET, the whale.
   - `white` — bright neutral ink. Compass process states (ACTIVE/MOVING),
               kept by Noah's explicit word.
   - `holo`  — flat silver, TERMINAL HARDWARE only (counts, chrome,
               navigation); the animated foil is nav/brand. */

     A filled .holo-bg chip weighs exactly as much as the section subtabs

     rank, and a group's count is a child of the nav above it. So holo follows
     every other tone's badge grammar: tint + its own ink + faint border.
     #C7D3E8 is the house flat silver (the holo foil family's flat form).
     NB do NOT reach for .holo-text here: it sets background-clip:text, which
     clips the chip's SURFACE to the glyphs too, so the tint silently vanishes.
     Animated foil stays reserved for navigation and CTAs. */
