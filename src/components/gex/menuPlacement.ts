==================================================
  SLAYER TERMINAL - WHERE A MENU LANDS
  (components/gex/menuPlacement.ts)

  The arithmetic behind an anchored dropdown, kept
  out of the component so it can be tested.

  IT EXISTS BECAUSE THE CSS VERSION WAS WRONG in a
  way CSS could not fix. The menu used to be
  `position: absolute` inside the toolbar, and on the
  Terrain desk that toolbar floats inside a pane whose
  box is `overflow-hidden` — which it has to be, for
  its rounded corners and to contain the chart. So the
  menu was CLIPPED at the pane's bottom edge. Measured
  at 1440x900 with four panes: the Overlays menu ran
  to y=696 against a pane clipping at y=475, and three
  of its eight rows were rendered, invisible and
  unclickable.

  A portal puts the menu at the body where nothing can
  clip it. What a portal cannot do is know where to
  put it — that is this file.

  ANCHORED BY EDGES, NOT BY A CORNER. "The menu's
  right edge sits on the trigger's right edge" is a
  `right` offset from the window, and needs no idea
  how wide the menu is. Anchoring by a top-left corner
  would mean measuring the menu first, which means
  rendering it somewhere invisible, which flickers and
  is a frame behind on every scroll.
