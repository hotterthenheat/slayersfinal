/*
==================================================
  SLAYER TERMINAL - TICKER QUICK-PICK
  The compact in-header ticker switcher shared by
  the flow-board minis, the 4-way chart board and
  the live chart's fullscreen strip. The menu is a
  full-universe search (S&P 500 + NASDAQ listings),
  not a watchlist — four presets and a blind text
  box was the whole reachable market until Noah
  called it (2026-08-18). Unknown symbols still
  pick on Enter; the sim synthesizes them.
