  WHICH LENS RUNS ON WHICH TENOR (Noah, 2026-08-07). A fully-crossed grid
  sells nonsense trades: a scalp's whole thesis is an intraday hold (no
  business on tenors DEFINED by holding overnight — though the math spec's
  own ruling keeps it on weeklies), and Rebounds' math is a days-to-weeks
  bounce (a year-long instrument for a two-week thesis is twelve months of
  premium for a fortnight of idea). Discounted and Whale Sweeps are genuinely
  tenor-agnostic. This map IS the backtest spec's candidate-eligibility gate —
  the journal and the harness inherit it, so we never evaluate a combination
  the product doesn't sell.
