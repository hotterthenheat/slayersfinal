==================================================
  SLAYER TERMINAL - DECISION JOURNAL CONTRACTS (journal.ts)

  The spine of the loop: choice → record → resolve → recalibrate.
  Compass-scoped: every record here describes a Compass decision (a scanner
  setup or a Weigher grade), what the engine SAW when it decided, what the
  market later DID about it, and how the weights were retuned in response.

  Frozen seam, same discipline as every file in types/ — the future backend
  implements these; the live journal writer and the historical replay harness
  both write the SAME shapes, distinguished only by FeatureSnapshot.provenance.

  Semantics that are load-bearing:
  · DecisionEvent and FeatureSnapshot are APPEND-ONLY and immutable — a
    decision is never edited after write, only resolved by an OutcomeEvent.
  · OutcomeEvent facts come from REAL market data only. A target "hit" means
    price actually crossed it after the decision, never an inference.
  · Every decision carries engineVersion, so eras stay comparable after any
    recalibration. Weights never change silently — a WeightsRevision row is
    the only door.
